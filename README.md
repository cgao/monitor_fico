# monitor_fico
A simple python code to check the fico scores provided by Amex, Barclay, Citi and Discover

Need to install splinter https://splinter.readthedocs.org/

!!!CAUTION!!!

You need to put your bank usernames and passwords in the python file monito_fico.py
Don't commit the file to github or anywhere!!!

I know it's not a good practice. Glad to learn how to encrypt the configuration files.
